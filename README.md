HTML/CSS project for The Odin Project

This is a basic replication of the google homepage. By completing this I have introduced myself to very basic elements to the front-end development in HTML and CSS. This was done as a project for "The Odin Project". The Odin project can be found here https://www.theodinproject.com/
